Project Sendfood

Hello! I'm Ruslan Bayramov, a computer engineering student at Azerbaijan Technical University, with a focus on front-end web development. I am constantly honing my skills in the front-end realm, driven by my passion for technology and the desire to create innovative solutions.

Alongside foundational technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I enjoy working with modern frameworks such as ReactJS to develop dynamic and interactive web applications. To me, the web world is more than just lines of code; it's about enhancing user experiences, crafting aesthetic designs, and merging functionality.

This is my first HTML, CSS and JavaScript project.
